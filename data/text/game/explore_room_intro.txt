You look around. It appears that you are in some
kind of room. There is nothing in it - four bare
stone walls, stone floor. You look up and to your
surprise there is no ceiling - only perpetual darkness
of a night sky and a brigth moon, granting you it's light.

As you look around one more time you notice that some walls
now have doors on them (although you are quite sure that
there was nothing on them a second ago). You study the doors.
